    "description": "LOVED IT!!!...and I would say this is as good as 'Captain America the winter soldier' as it's in the similar tone to that movie and Black Widow brought out most of my emotions in this movie which is Excitement, laughter, and sadness. Let me just say that I'm a huge fan of the character 'Natasha Romanoff' including Scarlett Johansson herself along as her playing Natasha in the MCU movies too which she is so brilliant at...and no other actress would do it better than her..",

    "description": "Guys I highly recommend this film to you take your friends, family, associates   spouses and everyone . This film is THE BEST film I've seen since the year has started and probably one of the best movies going into a new decade.  The acting , costumes , production design , singing , sound mixing is award winning worthy and top tier . This is a feel good movie , you will dance , sing , clap, and even get a bit emotional throughout the film. There are so many standout scenes in the film that makes it so memorable especially those concert scenes where everyone was dancing in the theatre and clapping !!!as well as the studio session scenes where they were showing how the hits were made. MY GOSH  Jennifer Hudson gave an OSCAR WORTHY performance as the legendary Aretha Franklin ",
